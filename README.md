# Ruby calculator

### Brief

1. Create a calculator with an advanced and basic setting.
2. For the basic calculator make sure it is able to add, subtract, multiply and divide.
3. For the advanced calculator make sure it is able to calculate powers and square roots.

### Difficulties

I had some difficulty getting the answer to display as a float rather than two strings added together however I overcame this eventually.

### What went well

I managed to split everything neatly into functions and ask for and collect user input effectively with some validation checks.
